# ToDo
reating a To-Do List application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a great way to practice front-end development and build a useful, interactive tool. The application typically includes an input field where users can add tasks, a list that displays all added tasks, and options to mark tasks as completed or delete them when they’re done. Using HTML, you can structure the elements of the to-do list, including input fields, buttons, and containers for task items. CSS can be applied to style the interface, making it visually appealing and enhancing the user experience with transitions or animations.

JavaScript brings interactivity to the application, allowing users to add, remove, or update tasks dynamically. You can use event listeners to respond to user actions, such as pressing "Enter" to add a task or clicking a delete icon to remove one. Additionally, you could use local storage to save tasks so that they persist even if the page is refreshed. This combination of technologies not only creates a functional app but also reinforces key skills in DOM manipulation, event handling, and CSS styling. Hosting the project on GitHub is beneficial for sharing with others, showcasing your code, and even setting up a live demo with GitHub Pages. It’s an excellent project to demonstrate your front-end skills and make your portfolio stand out.
